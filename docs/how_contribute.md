## Before writing code

!!! info "Important"

    Please read this documentation before to understand how the repository is organized and how the language structure works.


## Setting up your environment

Check the [Getting Started](getting_started.md) page on how to prepare your environment to contributing.

You can check both [H-hat issues page](https://github.com/hhat-lang/hhat_lang/issues) and [TODOs.md](TODOs.md) page to see what is listed to be done. When picking something from the TODOs page, make sure to create a new issue through the issues page and selecting the "Feature Implementation" template. Fill it up accordingly (you can check the current open issues for guidance).

Once the code is ready, you can make a pull request (PR) to the H-hat repository. Write a comprehensive description, referencing all the issues it addresses. You can assign [Doomsk](https://github.com/Doomsk) as reviewer, for instance.


### Python code

The code must follow the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) settings from pre-commit yaml ([.pre-commit-config.yaml](https://github.com/hhat-lang/hhat_lang/blob/main/python/.pre-commit-config,yaml)) file at H-hat's python implementation. Check more on the pre-commit page on how to set up and run it.


### Community

At last, you can reach us out at the [UnitaryFundation Discord](http://discord.unitary.foundation)'s `#h-hat` channel to
learn more on how to contribute, address some questions, or chat, if you feel like doing so.
