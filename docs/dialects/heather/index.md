# H-hat's Heather dialect


The name is twofold: a [plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calluna)[^1] and a [song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crosswinds_(Billy_Cobham_album)#Side_two)[^2]. There is no especial reason behind the name besides the author enjoyment for the song.


[^1]: Scientific name: _Calluna vulgaris_, a small flowering shrub.
[^2]: Billy Cobham's Crosswinds album, second track of side two.


## Introduction

This dialect was developed to enable programmers to experience H-hat rule system and explore ideas for a new quantum computer science theory that intends to focus more on the computer science of the thing, namely manipulate quantum data rather than quantum states.

### Features

- **Statically typed**: data must have a defined type, and it includes variables
- **No statements separator**: there is no obligatory separator between statements, such as semicolon (`;`), but you are free to use it.
- **Whitespaces**: the dialect whitespaces are:
    - space, tab `\t`, newline `\n`, semicolon `;`, and comma `,`
- **Quantum data starts with the `@` character**: this includes variables, literals, functions and types.
