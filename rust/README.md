# Rust Implementation of H-hat

Rust implementation of H-hat. It includes the rule system and key features for development of the language, and a reference dialect ([Heather](hhat_lang/src/hhat_dialects/src/hhat-heather/README.md)) to evaluate H-hat code.

This implementation is currently in early development and may not be usable. You can clone and check it out for yourself, though:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hhat-lang/hhat_lang.git
```

There you can find this very code and also other language implementations.
